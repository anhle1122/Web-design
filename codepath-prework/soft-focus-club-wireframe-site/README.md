# ðŸŒ¿ Soft Focus Club â€“ UX/UI Case Study  
**Designed by Anh Le | CodePath Web101 Prework**

---

## Overview

**Soft Focus Club** is a recurring co-working and self-care event for students, creatives, and remote workers. This project explores how intentional UX design can create a calming, supportive digital experience for users who seek productivity without pressure.

The website serves as a low-maintenance landing page where users can view the weekly event schedule, explore upcoming gatherings, and find information on how to host their own sessions. Itâ€™s optimized for neurodivergent users and anyone prone to burnout â€” using soft visuals, simple navigation, and a content-first layout.

---

## Problem

Many productivity-focused events feel high-pressure or rigid, which can discourage neurodivergent or burnout-prone individuals from participating. Users need a space that encourages soft accountability, focus, and social connection â€” without being overstimulating or demanding.

---

## Goal

Design a visually calm, content-rich homepage that:
- Introduces the event concept clearly
- Supports discovery of this weekâ€™s meetup
- Offers a preview of future sessions
- Encourages users to host or participate
- Remains low-pressure, intuitive, and inclusive

---

## Target Audience

- Remote workers, freelancers, and creatives
- College students and young professionals
- Neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, autism, anxiety)
- Anyone seeking productivity without burnout

---

## Design Approach

The homepage follows a **gentle scroll-based layout** with predictable rhythm and spacing. The interface avoids clutter and color overload, using clear typographic hierarchy and a grayscale palette with subtle accents. Every section is self-contained and labeled for quick comprehension.

---

## Information Architecture

1. **Hero Section**  
   Title and value proposition â€” "What itâ€™s all about"  
   Three core pillars: Productivity, Self-care, and Social connection

2. **This Weekâ€™s Event**  
   Location, time, and RSVP options for the upcoming event

3. **Meet the Host**  
   A personal introduction to humanize the experience

4. **Monthly Schedule**  
   A horizontal scroll of upcoming events by date

5. **Gallery & Hosting Invitation**  
   Inspiration from previous sessions and a CTA to host your own meetup

---

## Design Decisions

- **One-page structure**: Minimal navigation required, perfect for mobile and neurodivergent users  
- **Neutral, calming color palette**: Avoids overstimulation and supports accessibility  
- **Readable font sizes and spacing**: Enhances clarity for users with sensory sensitivity  
- **Low-friction RSVP and contact buttons**: Reduces anxiety around engagement
